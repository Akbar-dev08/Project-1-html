    Choose your hero! A player needs someone to have something, so decide who you want to main first! This decision-making skill will be important when you reach Epic in Mobile Legends (Ranked Game).
    If you are new to the game, take advantage of the heroes you get first (AKA Eudora, Zillong, Layla, and Miya). Once you get the hang of someone, choose someone that can be based on your needs.
    If you want to use your skills more than a basic attack with magic power (Mages), you can use Gord, Esmeralda, Alice, or Aurora.
    If you want to have a hero that slowly develops over time with offensive/defensive capabilities (Fighter), use Balmond, Bane, Badang, Sun, or Guinevere.
    If you want to be the backbone of your team (Tank), use Tigreal, Atlas, Gatokaca, or Franco.
    If you enjoy using your basic attack with an extended range (Marksman), use Granger, Lesley, or Claude.
    If you like helping others (Support), use Angela, Rafaela, or Diggie.
    If you rely on quick kills (Assassin), use Natalia, Helcurt, or Hanzo.
    The possibilities can be endless with your selections!</p>

     Be wary of your laning. In the game, you will have the side lanes formatted for the first seven minion waves. The EXP lane will level your hero quicker, and the Gold lane will let you earn more gold for your equipment.
    The one carrying the special needs is the siege/cannon minion (AKA the one with an arrow).
     During the timeframe, the mid-lane will also be adjusted. Instead of a Cannon/Siege Minion, an Infantry and three Lancer minions will spawn instead.</p>

    Push your lane! Since the goal of the game is to destroy the enemy's base, you should destroy the turrets that are blocking your way. All turrets have a shield on part of the game, which will make it harder but can be helpful in any given situation.</p>
